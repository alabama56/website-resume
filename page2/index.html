        <h5 class="text">Hello, let me tell you a little about myself. I wont go into to many details, we can save that for when we are getting a beer after work. I was born and rainsed in Birmingham, Alabama. I attended the Mountain Brook school system and got myself a great education. Unfortunately I did not take highschool very seriously and was more concerend with having a good time. I did have a good time, incase you are curuous. After highschool I went strait into the United States Marine Corps, became an Infantry Assaultman (Shot rocket launchers and played with c4, tnt, det. cord, etc..) and got myself stationed in 29 Palms California. During my enlistment I was lucky enough to get deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, most people wouldn't consider that lucky, but most people aren't infantry Marines. After my time in the Marine Crops I backpacked across europe with my best friend, hitting 9 countries and 19 cities in 28 days. The only planning we did was buying the tickets in and out of England. It was an amazing experiance. From there I started work at a Metal Fabrication shop where I gained valuable skils that will last me the rest of my life. I started school at UAB and had to start working as a server, the welding job just didnt translate well into part time. I finished my semester with all A's, but I was not satisfied. I have a lot of problems with colleges and the education system, I wont go on a rant, but needless to say going to school for four more years just to start at the bottom of the job ladder did not sound very appealing. Being 23, waiting until I was 27 to start a career did not sound like something I wanted to do either. I knew that the tech industry is more concered with what you can do, than what you have done. A piece of paper with a fancy signature doesn't mean much if you cannot preform. Knowing this, I thought that getting into the coding and web develope buisness would be perfect for me. As someone with a lot of discapline and determination, learning to code and develope web pages is something that comes naturally to me. I have always been able to grow where I am planted, and I plan to keep learning and growing as I continue my climb up the development ladder.</h5>
